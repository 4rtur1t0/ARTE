%   Script used to change the coordinates of the points stored in STL format
%   The coordinates in files link0_base.stl, link1_base.stl... are referred to
%   the base reference system. The script creates the files link0.stl,
%   link1.stl, link2.stl. The points in these files are referred to its own
%   D-H reference
%   USAGE: Please follow the steps below.
%   STEPS:
%       STEP 1: Name each of the links as link0_base.stl, link1_base.stl,
%       link2_base.stl. And save them under the same directory of your robot,
%       namely, robots/abb/IRB6620.
%       The vertices in each of the STL files are referred to the reference
%       system of the robot base. They are normally expressed in millimeters.
%       Please do pay attention to the reference system in your robot's
%       graphics files. If your robot is placed with the Z0 axis pointing
%       downwardsk, for example, modify the initial T matrix as indicated
%       in NOTE 1 below.
%       
%
%       STEP 2: In robots/abb/IRB6620/parameters.m, set robot.graphical.has_graphics=0
%
%       STEP 3: Now you should visualize the STL files. They are normally
%       referred to the robots base reference system.
%
%       STEP 4: Write the DH parameters of your robot.
%
%       STEP 5: The units of your STL files are generally millimeters. If they
%       are meters, change the variable mm2m=1 in the following call script.
%       Run transform_to_own
%
%       >>transform_to_own('ABB', 'IRB6620', 1000)
%
%       which changes the units in the stl file to the standard meters.
%       The script should create the files link0.stl, link1.stl, ... etc.
%       Each referred to its own reference system.
%
%       STEP 6: In robots/abb/IRB6620/parameters.m, set
%       robot.graphical.has_graphics=1. Now you've got graphics for your robot!
%
%       STEP 7: Load the robot:
%       >> robot=load_robot('abb', 'IRB6620');
%       >> drawrobot3d(robot, [0 0 0 0 0 0])
%       you should see your robot in 3D
