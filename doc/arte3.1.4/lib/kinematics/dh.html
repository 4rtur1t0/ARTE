<div class="fragment"><pre class="comment">   DENAVIT Compute an homogeneous transform matrix DH in terms of
   Denavit-Hartenberg's parameters of the robot

   A = DH(TETA, D, A, alpha) returns a 4 x 4 homogeneous
   transformation matrix  as a function of the the Denavit-Hartenberg's
   parameters D, alpha, A and THETA for link i.

   A = DH(robot, q, i) is an abbreviated call to return a 4x4
   homogeneous transformation matrix as a function of the robot parameters
   robot.DH.theta, d, a, alpha the joint values q and the transformation i.
   For i = 1, the function returns the transformation matrix T01, for i=2,
   T02..., etc.
