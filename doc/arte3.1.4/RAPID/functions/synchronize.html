    [velo2, tmax]= SINCHRONIZE(qini, qfinal, velocity) Finds a mean speed and the required 
   time to perform a movement between the joint coordinates qini and qfinal. 
   If the speed of each joint is different, the maximum time to perform the movement
   by the slower joint is taken as a basis.
   
   Inputs:
        Qini: initial position in joint coordinates.
        Qfinal: final position in joint coordinates.
        Velocity: stores the maximum velocity of each joint.
   Outputs:
        velo2: new maximum speed for each joint.
        tmax: time needed to perform the movement.
