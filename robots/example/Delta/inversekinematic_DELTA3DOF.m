% Inverse kinematics for the Delta 3DOF parallel robot
% The Delta robot is divided into three different 2DOF arms.
%
% INVERSEKINEMATIC_DELTA3DOF(robot, T)
% T: homogeneous matrix
% robot: structure with arm parameters
% returns: all possible solutions for q = [Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q5 Q6 Q7 Q8] 
% that place the end effectors at the position specified by T. 
% Any Qi is a 9 value vector that contains: 
% Qi=[theta1 beta1 delta1 theta2 beta2 delta2 theta3 beta3 delta3]'
% being theta1, beta1, delta1 the joint variables of the first arm
%  and  theta2, beta2, delta2 the joint variables of the second arm
%  and  theta3, beta3, delta3 the joint variables of the third arm
%
% Eight possible solutions q = [Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q5 Q6 Q7 Q8],
% generally called elbow out and elbow in in eight different combinations for
% each of the three arms, as described in the following table:
%  
%               Arm 1       Arm 2      Arm 3
%   Sol 1        0           0          0   
%   Sol 2        0           0          1
%   Sol 3        0           1          0
%   Sol 4        0           1          1
%   Sol 5        1           0          0
%   Sol 6        1           0          1
%   Sol 7        1           1          0
%   Sol 8        1           1          1
