%   Q = INVERSEKINEMATIC_UR5(robot, T)	
%   Solves the inverse kinematic problem for the UR5 robot
%   where:
%   robot stores the robot parameters.
%   T is an homogeneous transform that specifies the position/orientation
%   of the end effector.
%
%   A call to Q=INVERSEKINEMATIC_UR5 returns 8 possible solutions, thus,
%   Q is a 6x8 matrix where each column stores 6 feasible joint values.
%
%   
%   Example code:
%
%   >>ur=load_robot('UR', 'UR5');
%   >>q = [0 0 0 0 0 0];	
%   >>T = directkinematic(ur, q);
%
%   %Call the inversekinematic for this robot
%
%   >> qinv = inversekinematic(ur, T);
%
%   check that all of them are feasible solutions!
%   and every Ti equals T
%
%   for i=1:8,
%        Ti = directkinematic(ur, qinv(:,i))
%   end
%   In addition, one of the solutions in qinv should match the original q.
%
